Why HubSpot? Because HubSpot is where the marketers, sales people and customer reps are - those are the people who benefit most from new tech without being techies.

Why Shopify? From building tools that could be a solution to a store owner's problem or save them some time, tech doesn't need to be so complicated - I want to help make that experience better.
- Daeda Wishlist - ```COMING SOON``` - It's simple, it's free. It's the easiest way to let customers save their favourites and return ready to buy. Tell us what features you want to see!
